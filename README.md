This repository contains a deep learning pipeline for binary flood image segmentation based on a U-Net convolutional neural network. The project was developed for a Kaggle competition on flood detection, which was part of an IUSS exam.

This repository contains two files: 
- U_net_segmenter_model.py, which defines the U-Net segmentation model and handles the loading and preprocessing of training images and masks.
- classify_and_generate_submission_csv.py, which performs inference on test images generating binary segmentation masks, and produces a CSV file formatted for Kaggle submission.
